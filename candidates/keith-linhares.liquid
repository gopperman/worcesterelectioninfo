  <h2>What are {{name}}'s Political Positions?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Housing:</b> Affordable housing is a central pillar of Linhares' campaign. Linhares supports several measures to protect tenants, including rent stabilization, Just Cause Eviction Ordinances, Right to Counsel for tenants, and Early Warning Systems for tenants. He plans to increase housing supply by strengthening inclusionary zoning to encourage denser, mixed-use development. Linhares promises to "develop in a strategic way to ensure residents are the primary beneficiaries of Worcesterâ€™s growth and hold developers and real estate speculators accountable." This includes ensuring developers are creating an appropriate amount of below-market rate housing, creating tax relief programs for seniors and other vulnerable people, as well as investing in the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, Elder Home Repair Program, and programs for first-time homebuyers.

    <li>
      <b>Police Oversight:</b> Linhares supports a Civilian Review Board with subpoena powers to "start changing policing in Worcester", following a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-finds-civil-rights-violations-worcester-police-department-and-city" target="_blank">DOJ report</a> that detailed several police civil right abuses, including sexual coercion and excessive use of force. <sup><a href="{{surveyLink}}" target="_blank">source</a></sup>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Immigration:</b> Linhares has called for a city ordinance that expressly forbids Worcester Police from assisting ICE: "Worcester City Councilors should pass ordinances to strengthen our position on Worcester's sanctuary city status and ensure that our police are not collaborating or aiding ICE in any way." <sup><a href="{{surveyLink}}" target="_blank">source</a></sup>
    <li>
      <b>Public Transit: </b>Linhares supports investment in improving WRTA's bus service, including the continuation of free fares. He supports the expansion of protected bike lanes across the city. He promises to advocate for investment in the DPW to build more crosswalks, sidewalks, and traffic-calming measures to make Worcester more pedestrian and bike-friendly.<sup><a href="{{surveyLink}}" target="_blank">source</a></sup>
    </li>
    <li><b>Sustainability: </b>Linhares supports adopting building codes that would mandate new construction and renovations make use of modern, high-efficiency heating and cooling systems. He favors incentives for new buildings to be designed for optimal solar panel installation, and to include EV charging infrastructure. In addition to zoning policy, Linhares wants to prepare the city for extreme weather events by establishing accessible heating and cooling centers, ensuring operation of community pools, and establishing more green spaces to improve biodiversity and climate resilience. <sup><a href="{{surveyLink}}" target="_blank">source</a></sup>
    <li>
      <b>Education:</b> Linhares supports universal pre-K for Worcester residents. In the face of federal cuts, Linhares wants to ensure that all Worcester Public schools have "robust budget allocation". <sup><a href="{{surveyLink}}" target="_blank">source</a></sup>
